Version 0.3 (Developed 2014-07-03 through ?)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Features:
* Relies on the `httr` package, which provides benefits like the status code message can be captured (eg, 200-OK, 403-Forbidden, 404-NotFound).  See http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/.

Updates:
* Renamed the former `status_message` to `outcome_message`. This is because the message associated with http code returned is conventionally called the 'status messages' (eg, OK, Forbidden, Not Found).
* If an operation is successful, the `raw_text` value` (which was formerly called `raw_csv`) is returned as an empty string to save RAM.  It's not really necessary with httr's status message exposed.

Bug Fixes:
 * Correct batch reads with longitudinal schema #27

Version 0.2 (Developed 2014-01-14 through 2014-07-02)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
New Features:
* Added `redcap_column_sanitize()` function to address non-ASCII characters
* Added `redcap_write` (as an internal function).
* The `redcap_project` boject reduces repeatedly passing parameters like the server URL, the user token, and the SSL cert location.

Updates:
* New Mozilla SSL Certification Bundles released on cURL (released 2013-12-05; http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem)
* Renamed `redcap_read_batch`  to `redcap_read`. These changes reflect our suggestion that reads should typically be batched.
* Renamed `redcap_read` to `redcap_read_oneshot`
* Renamed `redcap_write` to `redcap_write_oneshot` (which is an internal function).
* Small renames to parameters

Version 0.1 (Developed 2013-11-26 through 2014-01-14)
