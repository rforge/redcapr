This release is in response ...

I also made some updates to reflect newer CRAN policies (eg, using `requireNamespace()` instead of `require()`).

I've checked it on four local machines (two Win8s, one Ubuntu, and one Red Hat server), as well as Windows & Linux builds on R-Forge (https://r-forge.r-project.org/R/?group_id=1814), a Linux build on Travis-CI (https://travis-ci.org/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR) and Uwe's win-builder (http://win-builder.r-project.org/7fR2E6Q3F1FJ/).  Please tell me if there's something else I should do for CRAN.
