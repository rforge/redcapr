REDCapR
=======
We’ve been using R with REDCap’s API since the Fall 2012 and have developed a few functions that we're assembling in an R package: `REDCapR`.  The release version and documentation is on [CRAN](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/REDCapR/), while the development site for collaboration is on [GitHub](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR).

It was taking us about 50 lines of code to contact REDCap and robustly transform the returned CSV into an R `data.frame`.  It took more than twice that much code to implement batching.  AL this can be done in one line of code with the package's `redcap_read()` function:
```
ds <- redcap_read(redcap_uri=uri, token=token)$data
```

The `REDCapR` package includes the [Bundle of CA Root Certificates](http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem) from the official [cURL site](http://curl.haxx.se).  Your REDCap server's identity is always verified, unless the setting is overridden (or alternative certificates can also be provided).

The `redcap_read()` function also accepts values for subsetting/filtering the records and fields.  The [most recent documentation](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR/blob/master/DocumentationPeek.pdf) can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR).  A [vignette](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR/blob/master/inst/doc/BasicREDCapROperations.html) has also been started.  Here's are two examples; the first selects only a portion of the rows, while the second selects only a portion of the columns.
```
#Return only records with IDs of 1 and 4
desired_records <- c(1, 4)
ds_some_rows <- redcap_read(
   redcap_uri = uri, 
   token = token, 
   records = desired_records
)$data

#Return only the fields recordid, name_first, and age
desired_fields <- c("recordid", "name_first", "age")
ds_some_fields <- redcap_read(
   redcap_uri = uri, 
   token = token, 
   fields = desired_fields
)$data
```


In the next year, we hope to implement everything exposed by the REDCap API.  If there's a feature that would help your projects, feel free to post something here in the forums, or create an issue in REDCapR's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR/issues).  A [troubleshooting](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR/blob/master/inst/doc/TroubleshootingApiCalls.html) document helps diagnose issues with the API.

Our group has benefited so much from REDCap and the surrounding community, and we'd like to contribute back.  Suggestions, criticisms, and code contributions are welcome.  And if anyone is interested in trying a direction that suits them better, we'll be happy to explain the package's internals and help you fork your own version.  We have some starting material described in the [`./documentation_for_developers/`](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR/tree/master/documentation_for_developers) directory.  Also a few other currently-developed libraries exist for communicating with REDCap: [redcapAPI](https://github.com/nutterb/redcapAPI) written for R (which is a fork of [redcap](https://github.com/jeffreyhorner/redcap)), [RedcapAPI](https://github.com/eugyev/RedcapAPI), and [PyCap](http://sburns.org/PyCap/) written for Python.

We'd like to thank the following developers for their [advice](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) and [code contributions](https://github.com/OuhscBbmc/REDCapR/graphs/contributors): [Rollie Parrish](https://github.com/rparrish), [Scott Burns](https://github.com/sburns), [Benjamin Nutter](https://github.com/nutterb), [John Aponte](https://github.com/johnaponte), and [Andrew Peters](https://github.com/ARPeters).
